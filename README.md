# Final Project Summary 

The project notebook contains much of the same information here, but it will be repeated here in one brief summary. This project aimed to cluster CSUS courses by their catalog descriptions. In order to do this, the course descriptions had to be obtained by downloading and parsing HTML from the CSUS catalog website. Once the descriptions were obtained, they were passed to Bert (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for preprocessing and then for obtaining a pooled contextual embedding for each course description. From this point, the embeddings with metadata are saved into separate TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files so that they can be uploaded to TensorFlow Projector for further dimensionality reduction and for plotting. After uploading the files, t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is used to reduce the dimensions and reveal potential clusters in the descriptions. Once the t-SNE plot looks like it has converged to some degree, it is stopped and observed. The plot is observed for any insights that are revealed from this plot. The plot shown in the project notebook and below had three main clusters that revealed insights, such as descriptions being extremely generic and music majors having many classes that allow individual instruction. There were not many unique insights that I was able to gather from the plot that a more simplistic method could have revealed, which makes me think of a couple of ways this project could have been improved. Two such improvements could be fine-tuning Bert on course catalogs and using the sequence_output instead of the pooled_output; both of these would have better represented the descriptions in the embedded space. In conclusion, the project results were not as satisfactory as I would have hoped. However, some insights were obtained, and ultimately, I was able to utilize three of the concepts learned in STAT 196k: complex datasets, natural language processing, and dimension reduction.

Note that the assets folder is not included in this repo, so the files in that folder must be obtained from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bert/1)
